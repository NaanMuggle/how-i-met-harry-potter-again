Now about halfway through the class, we started Book 5 this week. *Order of Secrets* introduces us to Professor Umbridge, who J.K. Rowling makes sure we do not like from the moment we meet her. Beyond her toad-like face and sickly, fake sweetness, Umbridge personifies the division and tension between Fudge and Dumbledore. This tension, although the main focus of Book 5, had notable beginnings much earlier on. In Book 2, the Ministry (backed by Lucius Malfoy) sends Hagrid to Askaban, ignoring the claims of Dumbledore. For a brief period, they also remove Dumbledore as Headmaster. This continues on to Book 3, where Dumbledore constantly clashes with the dementors, who were ordered to Hogwarts by Fudge himself. However, the breaking point for their relationship came at the end of Book 4 when Fudge refuses to believe that Voldemort has returned. Afraid of losing his power, he rejects Dumbledore's authority, signaling the "Parting of the Ways". 

While this was a significant moment in the Harry Potter storyline, it wouldn't have been as big of a deal if it weren't for the other people who supported each side. This division brought out differences of opinion in people that already existed. Some people slightly favored the Ministry while others Dumbledore, but since they were on the same side, it didn't matter. However, with the break in that relationship, these differences became much stronger, forming an identity for each side. Percy practically disowns his family to support the Ministry. Seamus (and others) break off from Harry, doubting any words that come out of his mouth. I actually found many parallels between this and the situation in America today, particularly in regards to politics.

...And then we have Umbridge, who is the worst of all. She specifically tries to find ways to make this split stronger, punishing everyone who is on Dumbledore's side. As we find out later, she sent dementors into Little Whinging, hoping to provoke Harry into using magic, resulting in his expulsion. At Hogwarts, she is made into the High Inquisitor, with the Ministry giving her more and more power by the day. With this, we start to see instances of injustice and favoritism that we have never seen before at Hogwarts. Things that would never have happened in previous books but are somehow okay and normalized here. For me, forcing Harry to write lines in his own blood has  appalled and disgusted me every time I read this book. Under normal conditions, no parent/guardian would let that happen to their child. But in this case, no one can say anything -  because when they do, things get worse. Quidditch gets taken away, Malfoy's bullying becomes official with the Inquisitorial Squad, and Dumbledore is forced to leave. 

In all of this, people stop depending on each other. This was what the Sorting Hat was afraid of and felt honor-bound to warn against. Even when Fudge does see Voldemort at the end of the book and acknowledges his return, it is too late. This is because the power of the divide came from the people supporting it, not the figures who represented it. Even when Fudge admits that Dumbledore is right, the Ministry and the Magical World remain broken. No one knows who to trust anymore, which is what Voldemort wanted in the first place, allowing him to swiftly ascend to power again.
