Now about halfway through the class, we started Book 5 this week. *Order of the Phoenix* introduces us to Professor Umbridge, who J.K. Rowling makes pretty sure we do not like from the moment we meet her. Beyond her toad-like face and sickly, fake sweetness, Umbridge personifies the division and tension between Fudge and Dumbledore. This divide, although the main focus of Book 5, had notable beginnings much earlier on. In Book 2, the Ministry (coerced by Lucius Malfoy) sends Hagrid to Azkaban, ignoring the assurances of Dumbledore. For a brief period, they also remove Dumbledore as Headmaster. These aggressions continue on to Book 3, where Dumbledore is constantly forced to clash with the dementors, who were ordered to Hogwarts by Fudge himself. However, the breaking point for their relationship came at the end of Book 4 when Fudge refuses to believe Dumbledore that Voldemort has returned. Afraid of losing his power, Fudge rejects Dumbledore's authority, signaling the "Parting of the Ways". 

While this was a significant moment in the *Harry Potter* storyline, it by itself wouldn't have been as important if it weren't for the people that believed in these two figures. There were always some people who slightly favored the Ministry and others Dumbledore, but those differences never truly mattered. However, with the fracture of that understanding, these differences became much stronger, forming an identity for each side. Percy practically disowns his family to support the Ministry. Seamus (and others) break off from Harry, doubting any words that come out of his mouth. I actually found many parallels between this and the situation in America today, particularly in regards to politics.

...And then we have Umbridge, who is the worst of all. She specifically tries to punish everyone who has even the slightest concerns about the Ministry, making this split even stronger. As we find out later, she sent dementors into Little Whinging, hoping to provoke Harry into using magic, resulting in his expulsion. At Hogwarts, she is made into the High Inquisitor, with the Ministry giving her more and more power by the day. With this, we start to see instances of injustice and favoritism that we have never seen before at Hogwarts. Things that would never have happened in previous years are somehow okay and normalized. Forcing Harry to write lines in his own blood has appalled and disgusted me every time I have read this book. Under normal conditions, no parent/guardian would let that type of abuse happen to their child. But in this case, no one can say anything -  because when they do, things get worse. Quidditch gets taken away, Malfoy's bullying becomes official with the Inquisitorial Squad, and Umbridge replaces Dumbledore as Headmaster. 

In all of this, people stop depending on each other. This was what the Sorting Hat was afraid of and felt honor-bound to warn against. Even when Fudge does see Voldemort at the end of the book and acknowledges his return, it is too late. This is because the power of the divide came from the people supporting it, not the figures who represented it. Even when Fudge admits that Dumbledore was right, the Ministry and the Wizarding World remain broken. No one knows who to trust anymore, which is what Voldemort wanted in the first placeâ€”a perfect way to swiftly ascend to power once again.
