Normally I would discuss our Harry Potter readings for the week, but given that it's Thanksgiving, we haven't really covered much in class. But of course, this is perfectly timed for another big event - the release of *Crimes of Grindelwald*! I was super excited about the film, and though we haven't discussed it in class yet, I thought I would share my initial thoughts. (Spoilers ahead)

One theme that I noticed that reminded me of the original books was of the different "sides" to the fight. In the books, there were three distinct sides during the fifth year - Dumbledore vs the Ministry vs Voldemort. Although Dumbledore and the Ministry were both against the Dark Arts, they still couldn't come together until the end when Voldemort arose as a real threat again. 

In this movie, a similar pattern arose. Grindelwald is slowly coming to power, bringing more followers to his cause. The American and British governments are fighting him, though they tend to resort to more violent methods. Dumbledore disagrees with them and doesn't want to fight like that. These policies also have an effect of turning people away. Newt didn't want to join the Ministry because he had no desire to kill Credence. (Side note - I'm going to call him Credence until I get more proof that he is Aurelius) Queenie wanted to marry Jacob, but her government wouldn't allow her that. In the end, these three sides dispersed into two as we see Queenie go off with Grindelwald and the British Ministry siding with Dumbledore (from the last shot). 

Another thought that came to me was about character development, specifically about Grindelwald. With the original 7 books, we had the privilege of having the space to develop our characters well, especially Voldemort. The movies also had the luxury of that background to build on when protraying its characters. However, with these new films, every scene becomes absolutely critical for showcasing who these people are. 

With Grindelwald, the first scene we have with him is when he escapes en route from America to England. From this, we see how someone from the American Ministry, who was a stickler for rules before, could come over to his side, even ruining his whole career in the process. For me, it showed how Grindelwald is capable of turning almost anyone into his supporter. In a scene soon after, we see that a French family killed so easily just to have a place to live in France. By having that scene come so early on, we as the viewers are informed that this is the kind of person Grindelwald is. He can murder a child without a second thought for "his greater good". 

Lastly, at the rally scene, he gave quite an impressive speech in my opinion. It highlighted his seductive nature, especially when he tells his followers to spread the word that they weren't the ones to fight with violence (or something like that). Everyone joins him with their own free will, as shown with the circle of fire at the end. It's why their support is so much harder to break later on, as personified by Queenie. She just wanted to hear what he had to say, but in that, he convinced her to go from loving Jacob to loving an idea more. With this, J.K. Rowling shows how people get recruited into radical causes - not with force, but with charm. 

Hope that was a nice little break from the norm! Back to the books next week.
