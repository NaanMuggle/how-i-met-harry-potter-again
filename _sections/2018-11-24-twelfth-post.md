Normally I would discuss our Harry Potter readings for the week, but given that it's Thanksgiving, we haven't really covered much material. But of course, this is perfectly timed for another big event - the release of *Crimes of Grindelwald*! I was super excited about the film, and though we haven't discussed it in class yet, I thought I would share my initial reflections. (Spoilers ahead)

One theme I noticed that reminded me of the original books was of the different "sides" to the fight. In the books, there were three distinct sides during the fifth year - Dumbledore vs the Ministry vs Voldemort. Although Dumbledore and the Ministry were both against the Dark Arts, they still couldn't come together until the end when Voldemort arose as a real threat again. It is interesting that in the case of books, the Ministry is against Dumbledore from cowardice whereas here, the Ministry resort to violence too quickly.

In this movie, a similar pattern unfolds. Grindelwald is slowly coming to power, bringing more followers to his cause. The American and British governments are fighting him, though they tend to resort to more violent methods. Dumbledore disagrees with their tactics and doesn't want to fight like that. These policies also have an effect of turning people away. For example, Newt didn't want to join the Ministry because he had no desire to kill Credence. (Side note - I'm going to call him Credence until I get more proof that he is Aurelius.) Queenie wanted to marry Jacob, but her government wouldn't allow her that. In the end, these three sides dispersed into two as we see Queenie go off with Grindelwald and the British Ministry siding with Dumbledore (from the last shot). 

Another thought that came to me was about character development, specifically about Grindelwald. With the original 7 books, we had the privilege of having the space to develop our characters well, especially Voldemort. The movies of that series also had the luxury of using that as their background when protraying its characters. However, with these new films, every scene becomes absolutely critical for showcasing who these people are. 

With Grindelwald, the first scene we have with him is when he escapes en route from America to England. From this, we see how someone from the American Ministry, who was a stickler for rules before, could be persuaded to his side, even ruining his whole career in the process. For me, it showed how Grindelwald is capable of turning almost anyone into his supporter. In a scene soon after, we see him murder a French Muggle family like bugs just so he can have a hideout in France. By showing us that scene come so early on, we as viewers are informed that this is the kind of person Grindelwald isâ€”through his actions, not words. He can murder a child without a second thought for "his greater good".

Lastly, at the rally scene, Grindelwald gave quite an impressive speech in my opinion. It highlighted his seductive nature, especially when he tells his followers to spread the word that they weren't the ones to fight with violence (or something like that). Everyone joins him out of their own free will, as shown with the circle of fire at the end. It's why their support is so much harder to break later on, as personified by Queenie. Queenie just wanted to hear what Grindelwold had to say, but in that, he convinced her to go from loving Jacob to loving an idea that would kill Jacob, more. With this, J.K. Rowling shows us how people get recruited into radical causes - not with force, but with charm. 

Hope that was a nice little break from the norm! Back to the books next week.
