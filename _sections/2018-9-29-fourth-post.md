Finishing up Book 3 this week...the early ones go by so quickly. This time, I want to discuss the treatment of magical creatures in Wizarding society. We talked about this some in class, but I've reflected on it more deeply and wanted to share my thoughts. While this book introduced many new creatures, I'll choose to focus particularly on werewolves and house elves (the latter which came up in the book before). 

Werewolves were originally normal people that were in the wrong place at the wrong time and got bit by another werewolf. Such people get a really bad reputation mainly because of the crimes of the those like Fenrir Greyback. Unfortunately, this prejudice damages the lives of even the best of people, namely Lupin in this book.

We learn that Lupin is constantly shunned by Wizarding society and is repeatedly fired from various employers for also being a werewolf. These interactions reminded me a lot of how people living with HIV were treated a few decades back, and even now to an extent. People don't really understand the disease, especially the level of risk it objectively poses to others. People fear them like monsters instead of seeing them as people first with a health condition second.  As a consequence, the public shuns those affected, even though these marginalized people used to be just like them. Even Ron expresses some of these shortsighted judgements when he yells at Lupin, *"Get away from me, werewolf"*. Despite the kindness that Lupin showed Ron over the year, such harsh animosity was manifested by someone most would consider from the best of Wizarding society. Granted it was a really stressful time for Ron (with his broken leg and being so close to an alleged mass murderer), the reaction is nevertheless indicative of the pervasiveness with which the bias against werewolves is present in this world.

Apart from the werewolves, house elves are brought into the series many times throughout, starting with Dobby in the previous book. Dobby's treatment from the Malfoys was so terrible, and so much so that he was conditioned to punish himself repeatedly. While this is an extreme, we see something similar later with Kreacher and the Black family. Sirius, as Hermione notes in the later books, was very cruel to Kreacher, treating him as inferior on many occasions. The only one in the Black household who did not treat Kreacher poorly was Regulusâ€”eventually drinking Voldemort's potion and giving his life to Kreacher so that he wouldn't have to.

The books mention several times that the house elves enjoy working and serving others and that denying them that would be wrong. In the US, slavery was justified for hundreds of years in a similar way - that blacks would not be able to function without guidance from whites. While Dumbledore of course treats the elves with lots of kindness and respect, I'm sure he was an exception in Wizarding society. Like Hermione, I don't believe that any species is born to be subservient to another; freedom is an innate desire of all living creatures. If anything, house elves were probably born peaceful and did not fight back when forced to serve. However, when such type of colored thinking is the norm, it's rarely questioned, even by kind wizards like the Weasleys. 

The biases that are in place in the Wizarding World were developed and reinforced many times over the years. With the house elves, no one questions their servant status. There is a deep mistrust of goblins and many wars have been waged against them, as evident from numerous times we hear about this in History of Magic class. In all the court cases that Hermione researched to save Buckbeak, most ended with the death of the creature in question. Even humans aren't safe - as soon as they change, even involuntarily, they are cast as "the other" and pushed away. In the end, it takes someone like Hermione to break the pattern - someone with an honest and exceptionally bright intellect to see the wrong for what it is and affect change. From all of this I am reminded of a famous quote - "A civilization is measured by how it treats its weakest members".
