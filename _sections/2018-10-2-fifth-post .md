Book 4 was probably my favorite book when I went through the series the first time. I really liked the structure of it all and how the Tournament drives the year forward. However, reading through it now, I found that I was noticed how much darker this book was in comparison with the previous ones - a major turning point of the series. It very much feels that Harry is against the world this time, as opposed to Harry + the world against Voldemort, a pattern that develops more as the series progresses. 

In the first book, Harry was starting to understand the Wizarding world, and how the world feels grateful to him for stopping Voldemort all those years ago. It all ends well with Quirrell/Voldemort's defeat, and we leave the book feeling satisfied. This is basically the same with Book 2, especially since there were no deaths and no permanent damage is left to any of our favorite characters. Book 3 has a similar story - everyone wants to protect Harry. Even the Minister of Magic comes to the Leaky Cauldron to ensure his safety. In the end, we find out that it was all a misunderstanding, and harmless Peter gets away - no big deal at all.

This book, however, was a major step away from that structure. We start off the story with the death of an innocent man who wanted to warn the police of this murder plot waiting to unfold. In the same scene, we also find out about Bertha Jorkins and how she died after being used for information. This breaks the pattern of the previous books in more ways than one - both that the first scene doesn't start off at Privet Drive and that an innocent person is murdered. Adding to this, the Death Eaters came during the Quidditch World Cup, and with them, the Dark Mark. As we find out, the Dark Mark and appearance of Death Eaters used to be a common occurrence during Voldemort's reign of terror. This is the first time where the Wizarding world has been struck by this fear in a long time, and the kids haven't even returned to Hogwarts yet. It made me feel like this danger is actually very real and much more complex than anything we as readers have encountered before in the series. 

Things get only worse when the kids do go back and face the Triwizard Tournament...which is actually quite a puzzle to me. They have this new rule this year: no one under the age of 17 can compete. Yet, this gets superseded by the rule that once Harry's name is drawn from the Goblet he has to play? Like what happened to taking care of Harry? As Hagrid points out, everything does seem to happen to Harry, but it seems like nobody is standing up for him anymore. No one is making Harry's protection the number one priority anymore. He's a 14-year-old boy playing against 7th year students in one of the deadliest games in Wizarding history. Sure he does well (thanks to one Barty Crouch Jr.), but I don't think he should have competed in the first place - namely because of what transpires in the graveyard. 

There, we see the death of someone who is fundamentally innocent, someone who is definitely on the good side. Up until this point, we hadn't experienced something like this, but Cedric's death was the first of many that are yet to come. Rowling has been building Cedric's character development from the previous book well; he's a honest, humble guy that gets along with everyone. And then he is killed for simply being with Harry at the graveyard. Adding to that, Voldemort returns and overcomes the blood protection that protected Harry before. When Harry finally returns to Hogwarts, there is no celebration or end-of-year festivities that we have come to expect with the years before. Rather, there is betrayal not just from Crouch Jr., but from Cornelius Fudge and the Ministry as well. It's the first blow in the battle that is just beginning with the *Goblet of Fire*.
