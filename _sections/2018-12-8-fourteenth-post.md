This week, we all presented our proposed adaptations for final project of the course. I really loved listening to my classmates and hearing about the creative ideas that they came up with. My favorites were the cupcakes, carnival, and Monopoly! As for my own adaptation and this blog post, I thought I would talk about my idea as well as my thoughts on the presentation.

My adaptation was a Jeopardy episode entirely based on Harry Potter to be carried out on the TV show. I have loved watching Jeopardy for years, so I thought it would be really cool if I could make an episode that could potentially exist on the show. Through my research, I have noticed that the clue writers of Jeopardy have a very distinctive style. They create a lot of patterns, and one can learn quite a bit just by listening to the clues. When trying to complete my own project, I tried to emulate the style as much as possible. As for the Harry Potter aspect, I had most of the questions come from the books, but I also tried to pull content from other adaptations as a reflection of this course.

From my presentation, what I thought was really interesting was how every person in the class had a slightly different set of knowledge when it came to Harry Potter. Most people knew the answers to the simple questions (such as the definition of a Horcrux), but other clues had much more obscure answers that only a few people knew. On top of that, it wasn't always the same people who would answer the more difficult clues. Some people were strong with questions from Pottermore, for example, while others knew some of the finer details of the books described in the series. My roommate had no idea who was the creator of *A Very Potter Musical*, but another student found that question really easy. It reminded me of the idea that every person experiences a different book when they read - because everyone has a different lens through which they view the world.

In terms of my actual adaptation, it made me think about revising the order of questions and relative difficulty. For those who don't know, the clues in each category are assigned specific money values, with more difficult questions having higher amounts. I based these values on my own view and understanding of Harry Potter, but the class as a whole almost had a completely different collective view. Based on this feedback, I may do some rearranging as an improvement on my adaptation. 

Apart from this, equally as interesting were the questions that no one knew the answer to. For example, despite how much controversy and publicity there was over black Hermione, not one person in the class (including me at first) knew the name of the actress in question. That actually surprised me a lot because it was something we discussed in class before. Looking back, I was glad to have included it, especially since I feel like it is important to at least know the name behind the face. I might think about adding more questions like these in the future.

Overall, I felt that the reception to Jeopardy was quite positive. While this version was intended for television, I think my friends enjoyed it a lot just as a celebration of the Harry Potter fandom. I have certainly enjoyed making this adaptation, and it was quite a nice way to finish up this class.
