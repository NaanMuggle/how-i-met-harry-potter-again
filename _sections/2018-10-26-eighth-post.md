This week we zipped through most of *Order of the Phoenix*. Although the volume was pretty extensive, one character kept sticking out to me as I read it - Neville Longbottom. Before this point, Neville had never been very good at magic, so much so that his family thought he was a Squib for a long time. He was raised by his grandmother, a formidable woman, proud of her children. For us, Neville's been somewhat of a mystery hidden in plain sight so far. We never really question where his parents were in the first few books, that is until Harry finds out in Book 4. Even then, he's still been more or less a source of comic relief for readers. Book 5 is where Neville grows up really, going back full circle and living up to his parents' legacy. 

With the divide, all of Harry's friends start taking sides at the beginning of the book. Seamus (and much of the school) believe Harry is lying. However, some, like Neville, staunchly support Harry. This moment is really important for us readers as it solidifies Neville as someone we can count on always being there for Harry. Neville is one of the first people who want to sign up for the DA later on. As Harry notes, Neville was one of the hardest workers in the DA, pushing himself to learn as much as he can. 

Then comes Christmas time, which is where the rest of our group find out about Neville's parents, who are really the reason why Neville has been working so hard. At St. Mungo's, we meet Alice and Frank Longbottom, who were being visited by Neville and his grandmother. It was a really difficult moment for Neville, which was even apparent through Harry's eyes. Everyone laughs at him for nearly everything, and this was something he didn't want people to make fun of too. This moment also helped me realize how much Voldemort and his Death Eaters have impacted his life. So far, of our main group, Harry has been the only one whose life has been significantly impacted by Voldemort. With this moment, J.K. Rowling shows that the same is true for Neville, who, unlike Harry, has had to live with full knowledge of his whole life. With the escape of his parents' torturers, Neville works even harder. He probably knows the threat that  his parents succumbed to is coming once again, and he wants to be ready.

And the moment he was preparing for comes near the end with the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Along with his friends, Neville fights against the Death Eaters that his parents once fought against, using his father's wand. This culminates in torture by the same Bellatrix Lestrange who forced his parents into insanity. In that moment, he refuses to give Harry up, much like how his parents refused to give in before they were tortured. This critical moment is when Neville comes full circle with his past, similar to how Harry had at the end of the book before when facing Voldemort. Neville's bravery helps him live up to his parents, showing himself that he can take their place in this long war against Voldemort. 

At the end of the novel, we finally get to hear the prophecy that was lost in the battle. Here, Neville is brought in a very strange twist of fate. The boy who had the power to defeat Voldemort could have been him or Neville, but Voldemort chose Harry when he attacked him that night fourteen years ago. When I read this, I didn't really feel that this choice meant that Neville's life was a lot better than Harry's. Neville and Harry grew up very differently, but both had difficult lives without their parents. They both have learned to grow out of their past, and they both will eventually destroy Voldemort together. Even without a scar on his head, Neville is admirable and worth looking up to.
