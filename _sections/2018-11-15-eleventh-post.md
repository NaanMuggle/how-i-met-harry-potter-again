This week we finished the first half or so of Book 7...nearing the end now. While this book has many themes, one that particularly stuck out to me was that of wands. The subject has been brought up before, but wands are a much more central component to this book. For me, before this book, the idea that a wand and a wizard were joined together was almost sacred. It was a key element to the series, especially since it was introduced to us so early. Well, like many other patterns and themes, Book 7 does away with that almost completely, which makes it all the more tragic.

In the first book (and movie), one of the best scenes was when Harry gets his wand. It's a confirmation that he belongs in the Wizarding World, that he has powerful magic. Throughout the books, the wand has been his constant companion, even more so than any character or magical item. His wand becomes an integral part of the graveyard scene in *Goblet of Fire*, as we find out how the twin cores protected him. More broadly, we learn that every wizard's wand is unique, from the length to its core, and is a reflection of who they are.

However, this bond gets broken in Book 7 and very thoroughly so. Right from the beginning, Voldemort takes away Lucius's wand. Even though I don't particularly love Lucius, that hurt me a little bit. Loyalty to the Dark Lord is one thing, but having to give up your wand? Even worse, Lucius's wand gets destroyed by Harry's wand, leaving Lucius with no chance of getting it back. Of course, lost wands become a pattern that comes up later on.

In the Ministry, we find out that every Muggleborn's wand has been taken from them when they came in for questioning. Umbridge questions Mrs. Cattermole about who she stole her wand from, and poor Mrs. Cattermole cries as she says that it chose her. In response, Umbridge retorts that wands only choose witches or wizards. Again, we see how wands are used as identification with the Wizarding World. In this context, the Ministry under Voldemort wants to get rid of all Muggleborns, so they get rid of their identification - their wand. 

While this was a horrible moment, it still did not prepare me (even on a reread) for the loss of Harry's wand. His use of different wands in the following chapters make it even sadder, especially because he had been counting so much on the twin cores to protect him. Every wand he experiences is a little different, reflective of the person who it belonged to. Draco's and Hermione's wands were much friendlier and easier to use for Harry than Bellatrix's or the other blackthorne wand from the Snatcher's. As an aside, it's really interesting that, in his flashback, Voldemort mocks Lily and James for laying down their weapons. From this, it made me realize that Lily and James are much more than their wands - they are courageous. This of course begs the question of what Voldemort is without his wand...not very much really.

In all of this, it also shows that nobody is safe from this bond between wand and wizard being broken, whether they are on Harry's or Voldemort's side. It seems that ever since this line was crossed with Lucius, stealing and using others' wands became common practice. Of course, these cases are also intertwined with Voldemort's hunt for the most powerful wand of all - the Elder Wand. He spares no one, even breaking into Dumbledore's grave to retrieve it. I think a really beautiful moment for me was when Harry finally gets his chance with the Elder Wand. Even though the Elder Wand is his and is much more powerful than any of the others he has struggled with the past few months, his only act with it (beyond rebounding Voldemort's spell) was to repair his own wand. Harry had never wanted power, so naturally he wouldn't want the Elder Wand, the manifestation of power. Harry only wants his own wand, for it represents all he ever wanted -  a place in the Wizarding World meant just for him.
