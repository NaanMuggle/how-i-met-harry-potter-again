Since I refuse to discuss the end of Book 5 any more than I have to, I am moving on to the *Half-Blood Prince*! While this book had many major themes, one especially important was that of love. It drives much of the plot between Harry, Ron, Hermione, and other characters in this book, with many complications and drama of course. In Professor Slughorn's first class, Slughorn notes that Amortentia was probably "the most dangerous and powerful potion" in the room. While some of the boys obviously don't take this seriously, Rowling encourages us to through the unfortunate story of Merope Gaunt.

We are first introduced to Merope in Harry's first private lesson with Dumbledore as we go through the memory of Bob Ogden. She's painted as bit of a Cinderella figure at first - abused, defeated, but most likely a good person worth rescuing. Her only source of solace was her crush on the handsome Muggle boy in town, Tom Riddle. Even that glimmer of happiness is taken away from her by her abusive family, as Marvolo strangles her for being a "filthy little blood traitor". After the memory, we learn that Merope tricked Tom Riddle Sr. into running away with her, most likely from a love potion. When Tom is released from this enchantment a few months later, he instantly abandoned Merope and their unborn child, never looking back.

The first time I read this section, I felt really terrible for Merope; it seemed that she lived such a pitiable life. Even later on, she was conned into giving up her priceless locket of Salazar Slytherin for a mere 10 Galleons, dying soon in poverty after giving birth. However, this time around, I realized for the first time that Merope (partially innocently) was committing a form of sexual assault on Tom Riddle. It was hard to notice it before, especially in the construct Rowling creates to introduce Merope to us. Merope was only 18 years old when all of this happened, with no formal education and was likely secluded from the rest of the Wizarding World. On top of that, the stereotypical gender roles and intent of sexual assault are flipped, with the woman in this case drugging and assaulting the man. In this case, it was out of hope that he will actually come to love and save her. Furthermore, Dumbledore also notes that she most likely felt terrible about it afterward, not able to bring herself to do magic or have any desire to live once Tom left. These factors make it exceedingly difficult to have a clear opinion on who to sympathize with. With all of her prior emotional and physical abuse, Merope probably didn't understand the implications of her actions at first, and by the time she did, she perhaps felt she was too deep to get out. On the other hand, Tom Riddle Sr. had no control over his actions for those few months and was forced into marrying and conceiving a child by Merope. Still, he was not a faultless victim; an arrogant and spoiled man, he looked on Merope's family and consciously chose to leave her out in the cold later on. 

The main reason this story is incorporated into the series is because Dumbledore is trying to show Harry Voldemort's life, starting from his conception. Although we can't know for sure, Voldemort probably realized his mother's foolish crush was the weakness that led to her death. This likely was the foundation for his contempt for the power of true love, mistaking his mother's infatuation to be the same as Lily's love for Harry. Another commentary that I have heard before is that Voldemort himself was unable to love as he was the product of a loveless and abandoned marriage. This new perspective of the assault, however, adds further depth to that analysis. Far from just loveless, Voldemort was born out of a crime (as we would perceive it today). Since this was his beginning, perhaps it is part of the reason of why Voldemort never hesitates in his quest for power, even if it means breaking any and every rule in his way.
