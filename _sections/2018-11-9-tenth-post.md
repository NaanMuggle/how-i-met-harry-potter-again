Book 6 finally came to an end this past week, bringing the death of Dumbledore and the flight of Snape. However, the character I paid most attention to during this re-read was Draco Malfoy. In the novels so far, it has been quite apparent that Draco is a product of his upbringing. He comes from an old, wealthy Wizarding family and strongly believes in pure-blood supremacy. Like all of his ancestors, he is naturally placed into the Slytherin house upon arrival in Hogwarts. As pattern would follow, he would then also become a Death Eater like his father.

Yet, in this book, we see a different side of Draco. The benefit of a re-read is that we know what Draco is going through as we read the book, rather than being left with the task of piecing it together at the end. At the end of Book 5, Draco's father was caught and arrested at the Department of Mysteries as a Death Eater. This leaves Draco with only his mother to take care of him, a single-parent household. His family no longer has the same pull it once had, as is apparent through Slughorn's indifference towards Draco when picking members for the Slug Club. On top of that, Voldemort is furious with Lucius for losing his notebook (which we know is a Horcrux) in a silly battle of revenge against the Weasleys. As such, he punishes Draco, Lucius' only son, to a nearly impossible task - killing Dumbledore.

This time around, I really felt for Draco. Even with all that he's done in previous books, he was still mostly a child. Draco grew up with the impression that the Dark Lord takes care of his followers, that he rewards them for loyalty. Yet, he had never realized what it was like to defy Voldemort, even by mistake. Now having experienced that pain through his father, he is understandably scared out of his mind. We see this when Harry accidentally finds Malfoy talking to Myrtle - "No one can help me...I can’t do it…it won’t work…and unless I do it soon…he says he’ll kill me…" This is a real fear of Malfoy's, the reason why he's looking sickly pale throughout this book. His family had invested their whole lives into Voldemort, which backfired into Voldemort having the ability and access to destroy them. In this way, Draco reminds me a lot of how boys before WWI used to be. New recruits would be so excited for the glory of war, but once they got there, all they wanted was to go back home to their mothers. 

Adding to this, I feel like Draco's actions almost foreshadow (or backshadow in terms of chronological events) Regulus's actions. Like Draco, Regulus comes from an old, respected pure-blood family. He fits in perfectly with Slytherin, even becoming a Seeker on the Quidditch team just as Draco does several years later. At the same age of 16, they both join the Death Eaters like many in their family before them. Yet, the most powerful parallel between them is their faltering subservience to Voldemort. Regulus went back to steal Voldemort's locket while Draco disobeyed direct orders to kill Dumbledore. When we learn later about Regulus's story of redemption, we don't have as much background or context about him as others. However, even with only a small glimpse of his character, we know that this type of transformation is quite plausible - because we see how Draco, at least in part, was able to do the same.
