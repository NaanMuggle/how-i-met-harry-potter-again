Although I am (once again) not ready, this week we finished up the last book of the Harry Potter series. Rather than elaborating on a specific theme, I wanted to analyze a specific chapter more closely - *The Flaw in the Plan*. Given that this is the last full chapter of the book, a lot of events happen very quickly. As such, I felt it was worth breaking down and appreciating its finer points.

At the beginning of this chapter, Harry wakes up (but plays dead) from his time in King's Cross after Voldemort's second Killing Curse. This is where his life comes full circle, nearly 17 years later. He slowly takes account of his body and his surroundings. In that, he notices Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet after possibly being unconscious for a brief amount of time. This meant that Voldemort himself was weakened by his own curse, almost foreshadowing what will transpire at the end of the chapter. 

And who but Hagrid would be chosen to carry Harry? Hagrid has served as Harry's constant parental figure throughout the books. As Rowling describes, "the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle" - the emphasis on Hagrid's size brought me back to the first book. Hagrid was the first person to carry Harry after the first Killing Curse, so it is very fitting that he would serve this role again. 

When Hagrid and the Death Eaters finally reach the edge of the forest, Voldemort tells the opposing side that Harry Potter was killed as he tried to flee. He adds to this by noting that the Death Eaters outnumber them, that it is time to surrender. As readers, especially on a reread, we know both parts were lies. This is Voldemort's trademark - lies and deception. He knows that neither are true but are necessary to create an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty. This plays on the theme of truth that has been present throughout the book: while lies can be quite powerful, truth eventually comes through, as we see when Voldemort struggles to defend his lie when the masses rebel. 

The most prominent rebel in all of this is Neville. I've given some time discussing Neville in a [previous post](#week-eight), but this scene is the perfect way to build on that. Rowling has always reserved a place of finality for Neville, going all the way to the end of *Sorcerer's Stone*, when Neville won the House Cup for Gryffindor. Voldemort has been a destructive force in his life, similar to Harry's, and Neville completely deserves the chance to take him down. Adding to this, Neville has always had a struggle with identifying with the magical world, stemming from his childhood. By having him draw the Sword of Gryffindor, he (and we) can finally affirm that he belongs in this world, just like anyone else.

For the final duel, everyone has their eyes watching. No one dares be seen trying to upstage the only duel that really matters. Of course, to call it a duel is almost silly, especially since Harry basically talks for most of it and casts one spell. Yet, it is fitting that Voldemort deserves nothing more than that to meet his death. After all he's done, Voldemort doesn't deserve a grand finish. Rowling brings this out too - "Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken..." As we discussed in class, we don't get this ending in the film (probably to satisfy the aesthetics of the director). However, this was a crucial element for me. Behind all his talk and lies and fear, Voldemort is nothingâ€”a "shell". Many would have thought him a great wizard, but in the end, it only took a rebounded curse to take him down.
