This week we started reading the third book of the series, *The Prisoner of Azkaban*...enter our first glimpse of the dementors. They're black, wispy, shrouded figures that literally feed off the happiness and life of other beings. Apart from giving me nightmares as a child, the whole construct of a dementor is actually quite fascinating and probably also one of the most profound features of this series altogether. 

In more ways than one, dementors are fear personified. As Lupin says: "They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them... Get too near a dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself...soulless and evil. You'll be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life." Even their physical form is dark and hooded, playing on one of the most basic human fears - fear of the unknown.

A running theme throughout the third book is how Harry's experiences with the dementors affect him more than anyone else. He consistently remembers the darkest time in his life - encountering Voldemort as a child and watching the murder of his parents. That was the greatest moment of fear and sorrow in his life, and the dementors overwhelmingly bring him back there by their mere presence.

While Harry is definitely affected more by the dementors than the others (since he has had the most traumatic past), it can also be noted that everyone is frightened of dementors. As much as he makes fun of Harry, even Draco is frightened (as the twins later inform us) on the train when the dementors come. We learn even the Death Eaters are afraid of the dementors later on. The dementors eventually side with Voldemort but only because he allows them to feed freely, not because of any particular loyalty.

It is interesting that Voldemort himself is not afraid of the dementors, but it is not because he does not have any fears - his fear of death has basically made him insane. Rather, the dementors can't take Voldemort's soul away since it's mostly gone anyways, halved with each Horcrux. In that way, the dementors have nothing to gain from feeding on Voldemort.

From all of this, I feel like the construct of the dementor is a commentary on the human experience. Fear affects every person, regardless of them being on the side of good or evil. And the only way (that we know of in this series) to fight fear? Happiness...in this case, personified as a Patronus, a silver light fighting against the dark. I actually really love how this juxtaposition is worked into the story because it is one of the most fundamental parts of life. The opposite of happiness isn't anger or hatred, but it is fear. 

For many of us, there is so much we fear in life. That's why the dementor is one of the worst evils in the world...because it hits very, very close to home. As Dumbledore says, "dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises...it's not the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses". We cannot plead or hide from our fears, as much as we would like to try. Our fear, much like the Dementor's Kiss, can reduce us to only seeing the worst in the world and in ourselves. The best thing, and really the only thing, we can do is to face them head-on, as Harry does at the end of the book. His Patronus is a stag, a living representation of the memory of his father. In that moment, Harry identifies with something much stronger than fear - the happiness and love of his parents. Through the use of dementors, Rowling provides us one of the deepest and most important lessons of the series - that our fears do not define us.
