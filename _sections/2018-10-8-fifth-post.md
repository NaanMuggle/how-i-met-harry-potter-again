Book 4 was probably my favorite book when I went through the series the first time. I really liked the plot structure and how the Tournament drives the year forward. However, reading through it now, I found that I noticed how much darker this book was in comparison with the previous ones - a major turning point of the series. It very much feels like Harry is against the world this time, as opposed to Harry + the world against Voldemort, a pattern that develops more as the series progresses. 

In the first book, Harry was starting to understand the Wizarding World, and how the it feels grateful to him for stopping Voldemort all those years ago. It all ends well with Quirrell/Voldemort's defeat, and we leave the book feeling satisfied. This is basically the same with Book 2, especially since there were no deaths and no permanent damage left to any of our favorite characters. Book 3 has a similar feel - everyone wants to protect Harry from Sirius Black. Even the Minister of Magic comes to the Leaky Cauldron to ensure Harry's safety. In the end, we find out that it was all a misunderstanding, and harmless Peter gets away - no big deal at all.

This book, however, was a major step away from that pattern. We start off the story with the death of an innocent man who wanted to warn the police of a murder plot waiting to unfold. In the same scene, we also find out about Bertha Jorkins and how she died after being used for information. These events break the pattern of the previous books in more ways than one - both that the first scene doesn't start off at Privet Drive and that an innocent person is murdered. Adding to this, the Death Eaters came during the Quidditch World Cup, and with them, the Dark Mark. As we find out, the Dark Mark and appearance of Death Eaters used to be a common occurrence during Voldemort's reign of terror. This is the first time where the Wizarding World has been struck by this kind of fear in a long time, and the kids haven't even returned to Hogwarts yet. So far in the series, the fear and danger that we have experienced hasn't gone too much past Harry's own world - all of his problems had basically been isolated to Hogwarts, where he was protected by Dumbledore. However here, there is just panic and people are running for their lives. It made me feel like the threat of Voldemort's return is much more complex than we as readers had understood so far.

Things only get worse when the kids do go back and face the Triwizard Tournament...which is actually quite a puzzle to me. They have this new rule this year: no one under the age of 17 can compete. Yet, this gets superseded by the rule that once Harry's name is drawn from the Goblet he has to play? Like what happened to taking care of Harry? As Hagrid points out, everything does seem to happen to Harry, but it seems like nobody is standing up for him anymore. No one is making Harry's protection the number one priority anymore. He's a 14-year-old boy playing against 7th year students in one of the deadliest games in Wizarding history. Sure, he does well (thanks to one Barty Crouch Jr.), but I don't think he should have competed in the first place. The inherent risk of participating in the Tournament creates plenty of places where Harry could have been killed or kidnapped. This level of exposure was precisely the reason why Voldemort wanted Harry to compete in the first place, bringing him to the graveyard. 

There, we see the death of someone who is fundamentally innocent, someone who is definitely on the good side. Up until now, we hadn't experienced anything like this, and Cedric's death was the first of many yet to come. Rowling has been building Cedric's character from the previous book carefully; he's an honest, humble guy that gets along with everyone. And then he is killed for simply being with Harry. Adding to that, Voldemort returns using Harry's own blood, overcoming the protection that saved Harry before. When Harry finally returns to Hogwarts, there is no celebration or end-of-year festivities that we have come to expect. Rather, there is betrayal, not just from Crouch Jr., but from Cornelius Fudge as well. With this, we lose much of our trust in the Wizarding World - people are dying, Voldemort is back, and the Ministry isn't in our side anymore. The *Goblet of Fire* is the first shot in the battle that is yet to come.
